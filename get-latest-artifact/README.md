A wee utility to print out the latest github actions artifact for a repo.

Usage:

```get-latest-artifact --repo-owner=mygithubusername --repo-name=myrepo```

This will print either the download URL for the latest artifact for that owner and repo, or nothing.

Specify ```--output``` of ```name```, ```url``` or ```archiveurl``` to print out....that.
