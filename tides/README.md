This is a script to pull tide forecasts from marine.ie - I haven't figured out what to do with it yet, it will likely feature in my homeassistant dashboard for walk planning

(Note: I don't see anything in the ToS for marine.ie that says you can't do this, I'm not using it for anything commercial etc. etc.)
